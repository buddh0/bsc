	//
	// There are a few important caveats in this mechanism:
	//   - The bad block tracking is ephemeral, in-memory only. We must never
	//     persist any bad block information to disk as a bug in Geth could end
	//     up blocking a valid chain, even if a later Geth update would accept
	//     it.
	//   - Bad blocks will get forgotten after a certain threshold of import
	//     attempts and will be retried. The rationale is that if the network
	//     really-really-really tries to feed us a block, we should give it a
	//     new chance, perhaps us being racey instead of the block being legit
	//     bad (this happened in Geth at a point with import vs. pending race).
	//   - Tracking all the blocks built on top of the bad one could be a bit
	//     problematic, so we will only track the head chain segment of a bad
	//     chain to allow discarding progressing bad chains and side chains,
	//     without tracking too much bad data.
